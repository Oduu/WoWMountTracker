# World of Warcraft Mount Tracker

The purpose of this app is to track which mounts you are farming, for each one you can tick it off once it's been farmed on a particular character to give you a better UI to keep track of your progress each week.

# Features (WIP)

- Supports multiple characters
- Status resets automatically on reset day
- Repo contains all mounts, with images and sources
